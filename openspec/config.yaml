# Project context (optional)
# This is shown to AI when creating artifacts.
# Add your tech stack, conventions, style guides, domain knowledge, etc.
# Example:
#   context: |
#     Tech stack: TypeScript, React, Node.js
#     We use conventional commits
#     Domain: e-commerce platform

# Per-artifact rules (optional)
# Add custom rules for specific artifacts.
# Example:
#   rules:
#     proposal:
#       - Keep proposals under 500 words
#       - Always include a "Non-goals" section
#     tasks:
#       - Break tasks into chunks of max 2 hours

context: |
  Process: This repo uses the OpenSpec workflow. Always read AGENTS.md.
  OpenSpec docs: spec.md is requirements-only. Put narrative context in openspec/specs/<capability>/context.md (purpose, rationale, examples, ops notes).

rules:
  context_docs:
    - Context docs are free-form but should include purpose/scope, decisions, constraints, failure modes, and at least one example.
    - Do not duplicate normative requirements; link to spec.md.
